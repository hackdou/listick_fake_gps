## How does it work?
Android has the Mock Locations feature, which is usually necessary for developers to test their own applications. We noticed that we can use this parameter for spoofing locations in most apps, so other apps on your device get dummy coordinates instead of real ones.

How do I start spoofing a location? After installing this application, you must make some changes to your phone's settings. There are instructions available in the app to enable these settings, which you can follow. Alternatively, you can follow the instructions below:

1. Enable Developer Options in phone Settings. You can see how to do this on manufacturer website.
2. Go to the developer settings, and find Mock Location (or Simulate Location) item.
3. Click on it and pick Listick Fake GPS.
## Why would I do that?
There are many scenarios for using this application - social networks, games, and so on. And it also helps you to stay anonymous online.

## How to use it without developer options?
There are two ways to do this:
1. The first way (Only for Android Oreo and lower) In the application settings there Is a "Move to system" item, click on it and phone will reboot, after booting the system, you will notice that the application is in system partition.
2. The second way: Move .apk of Listick Fake GPS in /system/priv-app/ manually. You can use TWRP or System App Converter to do this.
